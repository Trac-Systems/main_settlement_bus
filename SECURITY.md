## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability affecting the TRAC Network,  
please **do not disclose it publicly** (e.g., on social media, Discord, or GitHub Issues).

Instead, report it responsibly and confidentially through one of the following contacts:

- 📧 **info@trac.network** — protocol, API, infrastructure, or tooling vulnerabilities 

Alternatively, you can use the **“Report a vulnerability”** option on GitHub if available.

---

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- **Do not exploit or test vulnerabilities on mainnet.**  
  Use **testnet** environments or isolated local nodes for proof-of-concepts (PoCs).  
- Include clear and reproducible details in your report:
  - affected **component or module**,  
  - minimal **proof of concept (PoC)** showing the issue,  
  - expected vs. actual behavior,  
  - estimated **impact** (e.g., fund loss, network instability, or data integrity issue),  
  - any relevant **logs or transaction hashes** if applicable.  
- Please avoid:
  - phishing or social engineering,  
  - denial-of-service (DoS) or spam tests,  
  - public disclosure before coordinated remediation.

---

### Response Process

- You will receive an **acknowledgment within 72 hours** of submission.  
- The TRAC Network security team will investigate and validate the issue.  
- If confirmed, we’ll provide updates on the **remediation plan and timeline**.  
- After a fix is deployed, we may publicly recognize your contribution (with your consent).  

Thank you for helping us keep the TRAC Network ecosystem secure and resilient 💙
